    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a <em>little</em> fruit</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp you’re like</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a moon I want</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to <em>hold</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I said lemon slope</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp about your</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp this <em>smoothing</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the fruit</em> &</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp then alone</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with my book</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp but writing</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in it <em>the pages</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp wagging</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp against my knuckles</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in the</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp light like a</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sail.</small></p>
